MarkBook Application

Developed By Kyle Meade, using JavaFX.

Submitted as a Grade 12 final project but developed all by myself.

App:

- Teachers and students can create accounts
- Teachers can create/delete classes and assignments for classes
- Teachers can edit grades for individual students within the classes for each assignment
- Total grades and what not will be calculated and displayed
- Students can login and join classes (Teachers can kick students out of classes)
- Students can view their assignment grades

All clientside with no networking. Databasing done with text files and string algorithms.

Current bugs:

- Either the The TeacherClassView screen or maybe the AssignmentManager screen will bug out and you 
have to press the button that caused the bug out again to fix it. Not quite sure what the exact bug was,
it was rare and haven't touched this for 6 months since this repo was uploaded.
